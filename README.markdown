# FrenchPress.sugar

A javascript action that beautifies javascript files into formatted code:

** Note: This project is no longer under development. It might work for you, but I can't guarantee anything. Good luck!**

* Uses the library from jsbeautifier.org

* To run use Actions->Javascript menu or press `Control + Alt + Arrow Up`

* This will not fix syntactically incorrect documents

* This is beta software, please backup your code in advance. You may _undo_ the action by pressing `command+z` (or Edit->Undo)

## Installation

**Requires Espresso 2.0**

The easiest way to install FrenchPress.sugar currently is directly from GitHub:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/switz213/FrenchPress.sugar

https://github.com/switz213/FrenchPress.sugar

Relaunch Espresso, and a new Javascript submenu will be available in your Actions menu.

## Development

FrenchPress.sugar is written entirely in XML and JavaScript using Espresso's [JavaScript API](http://wiki.macrabbit.com/index/JavaScriptActions/)! Feel free to mess around with the code or fork it on github!

You may email me if you have any feedback, requests, or run across any problems.
